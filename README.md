Github Discussion about NodeBots

A lot of nodebot wide discussions happen offline and in other repos (eg Johnny-Five). This repo is a place to centralize nodebot wide discussions, about changes that effect many projects, the classes and workshops, nodebots day, and any other kind of meta discussion.

There are no actual RFC documents here. If we want that kind of thing, lets [make an issue](https://github.com/nodebots/rfcs/issues/new) and "request for comments".
